# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Overview
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It is a simple, effective, and widely used algorithm that relies on the idea that similar data points are likely to have similar outcomes.

## Key Components
- K: The number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction.
- Distance Metric: A function used to calculate the distance between data points (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance).
- Training Data: A labeled dataset used to train the model.

## How KNN Works

### Training
- Collect and preprocess the training data.
- Store the labeled data points in a database or data structure.
### Prediction
- Receive a new, unseen data point (the query point).
- Calculate the distance between the query point and each data point in the training data using the chosen distance metric.
- Select the K data points with the smallest distances (the nearest neighbors).
- Determine the majority class (classification) or average value (regression) of the K nearest neighbors.
- Return the predicted class or value.

## Advantages
- Easy to implement and interpret.
- Handles non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data.
- Robust to noise and outliers.
## Disadvantages
- Can be slow for large datasets.
- Sensitive to the choice of K and distance metric.

## Common Applications
- Image classification
- Text classification
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
